Identify any gaps in the client team&rsquo;s understanding of these objectives, also how the client will measure success in achieving the objectives and set action steps to address these gaps.&nbsp; It is important that we understand what our clients are trying to achieve, in their own words, and that the focus of any solutions are on helping the client achieve those objectives.&nbsp; This is the hardest part of the process, but when done right will be critical to the success of our partnership with the client.</h3>\n<h5>&nbsp;</h5>\n<h3>Identifying the objectives is the first step to your Account Plan journey.Please begin with indicating below the top 5 client objectives based on your knowledge of the client and/or the client&rsquo;s website.</h3>"
